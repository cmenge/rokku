<p>ROKKU DESIGNSTUDIO GMBHtakes the protection of your personal data very seriously and complies with the statutory provisions in the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and in the current version of the German Federal Data Protection Act (“BDSG”) for the processing of personal data. In the following and in accordance with the GDPR, we would like to inform you of when and for what purposes personal data are processed on our websites.</p>
<br /><br />
<h2>1. WHAT ARE PERSONAL DATA?</h2>
<p>Pursuant to Art. 4 Para. 1 of the GDPR, ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<br /><br />
<h2>2. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DATA?</h2>
<p>Responsibility for processing your personal data on our websites lies with ROKKU DESIGNSTUDIO GMBH, Schrammsweg 11, 20249 Hamburg.
<a href="mailto:info@rokku-design.com">info@rokku-design.com</a></p>
<br /><br />
<h2>3. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
<p>You can assert the following rights concerning us with regard to the processing of your personal data:
<ul>
<li>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR),</li>
<li>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR) and/or erasure including the ‘right to be forgotten’ (Art. 17 GDPR),</li>
<li>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR),</li>
<li>Right to object to the processing (Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR) and the right to object to processing for direct marketing purposes (Art. 21 Para. 2 GDPR),</li>
<li>Right to data portability (Art. 20 Para. 1 GDPR).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you shall also be able to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority for data protection.
To the extent that we base the procesing of your personal data on the balancing of interests, you shall be able to object to the processing (Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR).
This is the case if the processing is not necessary for the performance of a contract with you, which is outlined by us in the following description. When exercising such an objection, we ask you to provide the reasons why we should not process your personal data, as carried out by us. In the event of your reasoned objection, we shall examine the situation and shall either end or adapt the data processing, or demonstrate our compelling legitimate grounds for continuing the processing.
Irrespective of this, you may object at any time and without providing reasons to the processing of your personal data for marketing and data analysis purposes (Art. 21 Para. 2 GDPR).</p>
<br /><br />
<h2>4. PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA WHEN OUR WEBSITES ARE ACCESSED</h2>
<p>a) Documenting the access

<li>Date and time of the access</li>

<p>The data are only used in anonymized form for evaluating the general user behaviour. These statistical evaluations help us to improve our websites for you and adapt them to your needs. There is no other usage, least of all a link to personal data.

<p>The afore-mentioned documentation data shall be stored on our servers for a standard 7 days and then erased, provided we are not legally obliged to store the data for longer. In such cases, storing data for longer periods shall be based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c of the GDPR.</p>
<p>b) Use of cookies on our websites</p>
<p>What are cookies?</p>
<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your hard drive and save certain settings and data for exchange with our systems or our service providers’ systems via your web browser.

There is no processing of personal data that goes beyond this. Provided nothing different is stipulated below, your data will be stored until the respective purpose of processing them has been achieved.</p>
<br /><br />
<h2>6. WILL YOUR DATA BE TRANSFERRED TO THIRD PARTIES?</h2>

<br /><br />
